< studying with love & joy /> 🧡


✨ This repository contains some codes that I developed in Python in the 1st - 2nd Semester of the Programming Language course of the Undergraduate in Systems Analysis and Development at Impacta University, São Paulo, Brazil.. Here you will find examples of code, exercises, challenges and solutions for various problems. The codes cover topics such as data analysis, programming and more. I hope you enjoy and learn from my codes.

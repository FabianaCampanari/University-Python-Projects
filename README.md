✨ This repository contains some codes that I developed in Python in the 1st - 2nd Semester of the Programming Language course of the Undergraduate in Systems Analysis and Development at Impacta University, São Paulo, Brazil 🇧🇷. Here you will find examples of code, exercises, challenges and solutions for various problems. The codes cover topics such as data analysis, programming and more. I hope you enjoy and learn from my codes.
